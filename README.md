# BezelCursor

**warning: root is required**

BezelCursor lets you access the whole screen with just the thumb of your holding hand, no matter how large the screen is. With a fixed, comfortable grip of a mobile touch device, you can use BezelCursor to easily and quickly trigger a button located anywhere on the screen, using a single fluid action. Your other hand will be free, to write note, to hold a bag, to do whatever you want.

## How to activate

 1. Go to Settings -> Accessibility -> BezelCursor.
 2. Switch on and click "OK".

## How to use

 1. Drag your thumb from the bottom left/right bezel (the screen edge) to the center. 
 2. Keep touching the screen and move the cursor to the target.
 3. Release your thumb to select the target.

## Does BezelCursor record any personal info?

No. It is implemented as an accessiblity service which _could_ record device usage, but BezelCursor **does not** record any personal data.
Internet access is required only for sending anonymous crash report.
